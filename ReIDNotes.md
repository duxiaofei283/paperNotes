## Re-identificaiton (Re-ID)

### Datasets

- VIPeR

- [**Market-1501**](http://www.liangzheng.org/Project/project_reid.html)

  > The dataset is collected in front of a supermarket in Tsinghua University. A total of six cameras are used, including 5 high-resolution cameras, and one low-resolution camera. Overlap exists among different cameras. Overall, this dataset contains 32,668 annotated bounding boxes of 1,501 identities.

### Other Datasets

- [**HDA Person Dataset**](http://vislab.isr.ist.utl.pt/hda-dataset/)

  > The dataset is a multi-camera high-resolution image sequence dataset for research on high-definition surveillance. 18 cameras (including VGA, HD and Full HD resolution) were recorded simultaneously during 30 minutes in a typical indoor office scenario at a busy hour (lunch time) involving more than 80 persons.
