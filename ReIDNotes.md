## Person Re-identificaiton (Re-ID)

## Datasets

- [DukeMTMC-ReID](https://github.com/NEU-Gou/DukeReID)

  - \[[Evaluation code](https://github.com/layumi/DukeMTMC-reID_evaluation)\]

- [PEdesTrian Attribute (PETA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/PETA.html)

  > The PETA dataset consists of 19000 images, with resolution ranging from 17-by-39 to 169-by-365 pixels. Those 19000 images include 8705 persons, each annotated with 61 binary and 4 multi-class attributes. The detail composition can be seen from the table below.

### Others

- [UnConstrained College Students (UCCS) Dataset](http://vast.uccs.edu/Opensetface/)

  > The UCCS dataset was collected over several months using Canon 7D camera fitted with Sigma 800mm F5.6 EX APO DG HSM lens, taking images at one frame per second, during times when many students were walking on the sidewalk.
  >
  > From these, we have labeled in total 1732 identities. Each labeled sequence contains around 10 images. For approximately 20% of the identities, we have sequences from two or more days.
