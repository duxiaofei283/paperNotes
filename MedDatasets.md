## Medical Datasets

- [**TrackVes**](http://nearlab.polimi.it/medical/dataset/)

  > The dataset provides to the computer assisted surgery community a dataset for the validation of __soft tissue tracking__ algorithms.

- [**CATARACTS**](https://cataracts.grand-challenge.org/home/)

  > Analyzing the surgical workflow has potential applications in report generation, surgical training and even real-time decision support. This challenge was organized to evaluate existing and new tool annotation algorithms in the specific context of cataract surgery. It relies on more than nine hours of videos, from 50 cataract surgeries, in which the presence of 21 surgical tools was manually annotated by two experts. 

- [**Cholec80**](http://camma.u-strasbg.fr/datasets)

  > The Cholec80 dataset contains 80 videos of cholecystectomy surgeries. The dataset is labeled with the phase (at 25 fps) and tool presence annotations (at 1 fps). The phases have been defined by a senior surgeon in our partner hospital. Since the tools are sometimes hardly visible in the images and thus difficult to be recognized visually, we define a tool as present in an image if at least half of the tool tip is visible.

- [**Hamlyn Centre Laparoscopic / Endoscopic Video Datasets**](http://hamlyn.doc.ic.ac.uk/vision/)

  > This webpage has been created to provide easy access to in vivo patient datasets and validation datasets. Permission is given to use and publish all data on this website. If you use these datasets we request that you cite the appropriate paper(s).

- [**EndoVis**](https://endovis.grand-challenge.org/)

  > As an endoscopic vision CAI challenge at MICCAI, our aim is to provide a formal framework for evaluating the current state of the art, gather researchers in the field and provide high quality data with protocols for validating endoscopic vision algorithms.
