## Medical Datasets

- [**TrackVes**](https://zenodo.org/record/822053#.WVocL9Pyvdd)

  > The dataset provides to the computer assisted surgery community a dataset for the validation of __soft tissue tracking__ algorithms.

- [**CATARACTS**](https://cataracts.grand-challenge.org/home/)

  > Analyzing the surgical workflow has potential applications in report generation, surgical training and even real-time decision support. This challenge was organized to evaluate existing and new tool annotation algorithms in the specific context of cataract surgery. It relies on more than nine hours of videos, from 50 cataract surgeries, in which the presence of 21 surgical tools was manually annotated by two experts. 

- [**EndoVis**](https://endovis.grand-challenge.org/)

  > As an endoscopic vision CAI challenge at MICCAI, our aim is to provide a formal framework for evaluating the current state of the art, gather researchers in the field and provide high quality data with protocols for validating endoscopic vision algorithms.
